`BrainWaveExperimental` contains extra functions for the [`BrainWave`](https://github.com/sam81/BrainWave.jl) Julia module that are still experimental. These functions may have received less testing, may be only partially documented, and their API may change considerably in time. Once these issues are addressed some of these functions may be moved to `BrainWave`.
